#Fake Google Homepage

I create this page as part of [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css).  This is intended for learning purposes only and should not be mistaken as being associated with Google in anyway (though I don't think that's likely to happen).

I've always been familiar with basic HTML and CSS but have never really tried to apply it in a deliberate way.  This was a fun exercise in terms of putting all the different pieces together.
